# Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project! Here, I explore the job market for data analysts. I look into which jobs pay the most, what skills are most needed, and where high demand meets high salaries in the filed of data analytics.

Please check SQL queries here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)


# Background
I started this project to better understand the data analyst job market. I wanted to find out which skills are most valuable and in demand, so I could focus my job search more effectively.

The data used for this analysis comes from Luke Barousse’s SQL Course. It includes information on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills.

## The questions I tried to answer through the SQL queries were as follows:
1. What are the highest-paying jobs for Data Analysts?
2. What skills are needed for these high-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills lead to higher salaries?
5. What skills should a data analyst focus on to get the most value in the job market?

# Tools used
In this project, I used several tools to help with my analysis:

- **SQL**: Helped me work with the database, pull out insights, and answer key questions.
- **PostgreSQL**: The system I used to store, search, and manage the job data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: A free tool that helped me manage the database and run SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Kept track of changes and shared my SQL scripts and analysis for collaboration.

# Analysis
For this project, each query was designed to explore different parts of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I tackled each question:

## 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To find the highest-paying roles, I looked at data analyst positions based on average yearly salary and location, especially remote jobs. This query shows the top-paying opportunities in the field.

Here’s a look at the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range:** The top 10 highest-paying roles range from $184,000 to $650,000, showing great earning potential.
- **Different Employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T offer these high salaries, indicating interest from various industries.
- **Varied Job Titles:** There’s a wide range of job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, highlighting different roles and specialties in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 2. Skills for High-paying Jobs
To find out which skills are needed for the top-paying jobs, I combined job postings with skills data. This helped me see what employers look for in high-paying roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
        LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

--------Skills required for those top paying Data Analyst jobs

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```
